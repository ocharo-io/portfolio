For the component’s defined layout — 298×298px on mobile and 494×498px on large screens — the source image should be:

Ideal resolution: 1000×1000px minimum.

Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) to match the SVG circle overlay and avoid distortion.

Format: JPEG or WebP; WebP preferred for compression efficiency.

Purpose-optimized variants:

Mobile: 600×600 px

Desktop: 1000×1000 px

Optional high-DPI: 2000×2000 px

These dimensions give a crisp appearance while allowing the fill layout in next/image to scale cleanly without cropping or blur on retina screens.
